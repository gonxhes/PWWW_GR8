    <p>Two years ago, Google’s release of the first Pixel smartphone radically raised the bar for the image quality we could expect from mobile cameras. Today, even as everyone else struggles to catch up, Google is extending its lead with the introduction of an equally revolutionary new camera. It’s called Night Sight, and it effectively lets your phone camera see in the dark. Only it doesn’t require any additional hardware or cost: Night Sight is a new camera mode for Pixel phones.

By now, you may have seen my testing with a pre-release version of Night Sight that was uncovered by the Android enthusiast community. The things that beta software could do were truly unprecedented and awe-inspiring, and the proper Night Sight release that Google is serving up to all Pixel models today keeps that high quality while providing an easier way to access the mode. This week, I spoke with Google’s Yael Pritch, lead researcher on Night Sight, about how the company built its new night mode and the constant improvements it is implementing</p><hr>
<h1>DJI MAVIC AIR REVIEW: PORTABLE PHOTOGRAPHER</h1>

<p>For a photographer or a videographer, the amount of gear they’re able to bring on a shoot is often limited to what can fit in their bag. As a video director for The Verge, my large bag is loaded with multiple cameras, lenses, batteries, tripods, mounts, and other accessories. That means I often have to leave my old Phantom 3 drone behind, which also means that I leave behind the opportunity to get great aerial shots. With DJI’s new Mavic Air, I don’t have to make those compromises anymore. Though it’s not necessarily being sold as a pro camera drone, I wanted to see if the Mavic Air could be suitable for more serious photo and video work. Sadly, it’s not quite up to snuff for demanding droneographers, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great drone.</p><hr>
<h1>Too much screen time can wreck your eyes.</h1>
<p id="date"><time><i>Date posted: 30-Oct-2018</i></time></p>

<p>Smart phones, laptops, and other handheld devices all transmit light. However, the blue light in particular may be toxic for your eyes.
Scientists at the University of Toledo may have discovered how blue light emitted from your technology has a potential to lead to macular degeneration — one of the leading causes of vision loss in the United States.Retinal, which is produced by the eye, is triggered by blue light and causes various chemical reactions. These reactions within the eye can be poisonous to the photoreceptor cell molecules rendering them damaged.When these photoreceptor cells die, there’s no regeneration. Protecting yourself may seem as easy as avoiding blue light — but it may not be that straightforward.
Not only does blue light come from our digital devices, it also comes from natural sunlight.
Also, certain situations such as using your technology at night can intensify the blue light as well. Transmitted blue light, especially in the dark, channels the light into a very small area inside of your eye.
One study author relates this phenomenon to using a magnifying glass in the sun — the light can become so intense and focused that it can burn your eye.
The blue light from these screened devices can also lead to dry eyes.</p><hr>
<h1>Why It Feels Like Facebook Is Listening Through Your Mic</h1>

<figcaption>Conspiracy theorists think Facebook has tapped your phone's microphone to target ads by listening to your conversations.</figcaption><br>
<p>It's a well-known conspiracy theory, but we've learned a few things over the past month about how Facebook works that might explain what happens when you mention products in person during a conversation, then see ads for that product pop-up in your feed.
I've had this happen myself. You're chatting with a friend in person or on the phone. Later that day or maybe over the next day or two, you start seeing ads pop up mysteriously for that exact same product. As an example, you might mention a new Airstream camper to a friend, and then suddenly you see an ad for that exact same model.
No one has ever really explained it, and Mark Zuckerberg flat-out denied it during his Congressional hearing last week. The beleaguered CEO said Facebook obviously uses your video camera and microphone when you stream or record a video, but denied any tampering when it comes to using a microphone to secretly listen to your conversations.
And yet--the conspiracy still exists.</p><hr>
<h1>Google’s lifesaving Undo Send feature comes to Gmail for Android</h1>
<p id="date"><time><i>Date posted: 02-Oct-2018</i></time></p>
<img src="images/news6.jpg">
<br><br>
<p>Google’s Undo Send feature has been saving people from embarrassing typos, mistakes, and other email taboos for years on the web version of Gmail. Now, the feature is being carried over to the official mobile version of Google’s email app, starting with a release on the official Android version of Gmail, according to Android Police. The feature should arrive with Gmail version 8.7.<br>
The feature started as a Google Labs experiment you had to toggle on before graduating to the official Gmail feature list in 2015. It works by implementing a time delay on sent emails to let you rescind them within 10 seconds if you happened to impulsively fire it out with an error in plain sight. It exists already on mobile within Google’s Inbox app on both iOS and Android. But for those who use the official Gmail mobile client, it’s been mysteriously absent.
<br>
Android Police notes that this may be a server-side update, so it may not be showing up properly in update notes for all devices and may require a restart of Gmail even if the app is already running version 8.7.</p>
