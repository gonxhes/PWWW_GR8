      <h4>WHAT TO VISIT!</h4>
      <p>No visit to the New York City area is complete without a trip to the world’s most famous landmark The Statue of Liberty National Monument.The Statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.  It was designated as a National Monument in 1924. It is more than a monument. She is a beloved friend, a living symbol of freedom to millions around the world. These exhibits are a tribute to the people who created her, to those who built and paid for her, to the ideals she represents, and to the hopes she inspires. Crown access includes the Liberty Island Museum and the pedestal observation level. Expect to see panoramic views at the pedestal observation level, limited views of Brooklyn from the crown level. Approximately 4.5m people visited the statue in 2016. By way of comparison, around 7m people visit The Eiffel Tower each year, and 3.75m visit The London Eye. Private boats are not allowed to dock at Liberty and Ellis islands. Therefore the only way on is via the ferry system. There is no elevator to the crown. From the pedestal you must climb an additional 162 steps to the top. Like any good woman, Lady Liberty doesn’t make it easy for just anyone to get into her head. She utilizes a narrow staircase, a maze of cast iron framework and humor as a defense mechanism.
