      <h3>Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL Review</h3><br>
      <p>One the upfront these might look just another flagship devices with no headline-grabbing and flashy features, although it’s the inside that packs the punch for a delightful performance experience.The all-new Pixel 3 XL along with its smaller sibling Pixel 3 comes with some bold claims by Google. The tech giant didn’t seem to shy away to boasts big for its new smartphones and well, we won’t be able to give our verdict on all those Google Pixel 3XL specifications or Pixel 3 specifications in this review until we get one in our hands. However, we got the chance to grab these handsets and get a feel to it at the launch event and thereby thought to share our early thoughts.
	  So, according to Google, these are the most helpful smartphone in the world with the most intelligent and best camera you’ll find in the market. Again, even though we didn’t have the chance to completely weigh these claims, still the machine learning supported camera is surely exciting and does produce some amazingly enchanting imagery.

      <h3>Apple iPhone XR review: better than good enough!</h3><br>
      <p>Really, both iPhone XS models are fundamentally just spec-bumped updates to the iPhone X. They have a new main camera sensor, a new processor, and a bunch of small updates that add up to a much nicer device than the X. One year after the notch, the arrival of the iPhone XS means we can look back at all the changes introduced by the iPhone X and see how they’ve gone, while looking at where Apple’s pushing the high end of phones next.
      Apart from the size, the XS and the XS Max are identical. They have the same cameras, the same OLED display tech with 458 pixels per inch. The XS Max has a larger battery, which is nice. After a week of using it as my primary phone, the XS Max feels both bigger and smaller than I expected. Physically, it’s the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus and the Pixel 2 XL, and it definitely shares the same surfboard quality as Apple’s previous Plus-sized phones.
      But the edge-to-edge screen makes it seem much more reasonable from the front.

      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+: Everything you need to know</h3><br>
      <p>Samsung's new Galaxy S9 and S9+ are definitely iterative updates over last year's dramatically redesigned Galaxy S8 series, but that's not a problem. Instead of going back to the drawing board altogether, Samsung focused on fixing a lot of the issues while making drastic improvements to the camera experience and retaining everything that made the last generation so great.No matter where you decide to buy the Galaxy S9, 64GB is the default storage space that's available with the phone. 64GB should be more than enough for most people, but if you want, you can always expand it with a microSD card.Like last year, there are multiple colors of the Galaxy S9 series to purchase: Midnight Black, Lilac Purple, Coral Blue and Titanium Gray. U.S. buyers only get access to three of the four — silver is only available internationally — and both blue and purple are slight updates over last year.
      	A few months after the S9's release, Samsung introduced two new colors in the form of Sunrise Gold and Burgundy Red.Burgundy Red and Sunrise Gold are available around the world.

      <h3>SAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH REVIEW: ITERATION OVER INNOVATION</h3><br>
      <p>In many ways, the Galaxy Watch is an extension of Galaxy smartphones and Samsung’s own ecosystem, rather than a standalone wearable. A new smartwatch that pushes the category forward has been a long-overdue option for Android phone owners. And while the Galaxy Watch is a new wearable, it just isn’t that device.You can use the Galaxy Watch to pay for things, track up to 40 different physical activities, and track your sleep. You can wear it for days without needing to take it off and charge it. Samsung even claims there are 60,000 watchfaces in the Galaxy Apps store, but the watch already includes a handful of interactive watchfaces, including one that blocks out the hours you have meetings so you can better track your schedule.
      Overall, the Galaxy Watch is a great example of show-and-tell by Samsung: it’s a decent-looking wearable with good battery life, a bright OLED display, other spec upgrades, and tons of software features.

      <h3>SONY 1000XM2 NOISE-CANCELLING HEADPHONES REVIEW: IMPERFECT BEST</h3><br>
      <p>The past year has turned noise-cancelling headphones from purely functional tools to help you survive a long flight or a tiring shift at the office into truly enjoyable music stations. Among my favorites have been the on-ear AKG N60 NC and the over-ear Bowers & Wilkins PX, both of which have elevated sound quality expectations from the wireless NC category . A big part of what’s supposed to distinguish the 1000XM2s from their predecessor is the audio self-adjustment that Sony has built into the new cans. This now includes “atmospheric pressure optimizing” that apparently adjusts to your altitude. Did I feel anything particularly special or noteworthy with this setting turned on during my flight? Nope. If you use Sony’s companion app, you can also activate Adaptive Sound Control, which is supposed to detect whether you’re walking, sitting, or traveling and tweak the NC accordingly. I found it a fiddly and inconsistent system, and since it reduces NC while you walk.

      <h3>HP CHROMEBOOK X2 REVIEW: SEMI-PRO</h3><br>
      <p>The HP Chromebook x2 is such a device. But instead of just presenting itself as a very good Chromebook, it’s designed to sell you on the fact that you can detach the keyboard and use it as a tablet. A detachable keyboard has a different set of trade-offs than the more traditional 360-degree hinge you’ll find on other “convertible” Chromebooks. If you think you’ll use it in tablet mode a lot, it means you can save some weight by leaving the keyboard behind. And if you keep the keyboard attached, you don’t have to feel the keyboard behind the screen when it’s folded up.It opens like a regular laptop, and the hinge is strong enough to hold the tablet up at a workable angle without too much wobble. The keyboard doesn’t have much beyond a trackpad, stylus loop, and keys, so it doesn’t weigh all that much. Figuring out the right balance so the screen doesn’t tip the whole thing over when it’s open is a challenge — one many other manufacturers have mucked up in the past.But unlike other full tablets with keyboard attachments, this keyboard has a much nicer and more laptop-like.

      <h3>FUJIFILM INSTAX SQUARE SQ10 REVIEW: DIGITAL DOWNER</h3><br>
      <p>The SQ10 has a hard time nailing the exposure if you’re in a situation with extremely varied lighting, like in harsh, low sunlight with heavy shadows. Otherwise, the film is as good as it’s always been. It favors rich colors and lots of contrast over fidelity, which has always been the case with instant (and especially Instax) film. It doesn’t perform well in low light alone, but the camera’s flash is more than capable. It’s powerful, but it doesn’t overpower the scene. Coming from someone who typically never uses flash, it was a nice surprise.The SQ10’s blockbuster feature, though, is that it’s also a digital camera, but don’t expect it to compete with the photography experience of a DSLR, or even your smartphone. It uses a 3.7-megapixel CMOS sensor, which is puny by today’s standards. And while the images it captures look good enough printed on a piece of instant film, the digital copies are low-resolution, flat, and often uninspiring.
