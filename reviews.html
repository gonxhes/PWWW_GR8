      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+: Everything you need to know</h3><br>
      <p>amsung's new Galaxy S9 and S9+ are definitely iterative updates over last year's dramatically redesigned Galaxy S8 series, but that's not a problem. Instead of going back to the drawing board altogether, Samsung focused on fixing a lot of the issues while making drastic improvements to the camera experience and retaining everything that made the last generation so great.No matter where you decide to buy the Galaxy S9, 64GB is the default storage space that's available with the phone. 64GB should be more than enough for most people, but if you want, you can always expand it with a microSD card.Like last year, there are multiple colors of the Galaxy S9 series to purchase: Midnight Black, Lilac Purple, Coral Blue and Titanium Gray. U.S. buyers only get access to three of the four — silver is only available internationally — and both blue and purple are slight updates over last year.
      	A few months after the S9's release, Samsung introduced two new colors in the form of Sunrise Gold and Burgundy Red.Burgundy Red and Sunrise Gold are available around the world.
      	<br><br>
      	<b>Price: </b> Samsung S9: <b>$750</b>&nbsp; &nbsp; Samsung S9+: <b>$915</b>.</p>
