        			<h3>Design and Size</h3><br>	
        			<p>2018 finds Apple believing that bigger is better when it comes to iPhones. The 5.8-inch iPhone XS is the smallest new phone in Apple's lineup. The 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max is the biggest iPhone ever, and yet it doesn't feel too big in the hand because this handset is the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus. Apple just got rid of the bezels. But if you're looking for a design that sits in between, one that Goldilocks would call "juuuust right," consider the 6.1-inch iPhone XR. This handset also features a different material, dropping stainless steel for aluminum. And while XS models come in gold, silver and space gray, the iPhone XR is available in black, blue, coral, red, white and yellow.</p><hr>
					<h3>Display</h3><br>
					<p>Not all new iPhone screens are equal. The 5.8-inch iPhone XS and 6.5-inch XS Max boast vivid Super Retina OLED panels, and based on our testing, their even brighter than the screen on the iPhone X. The 6.1-inch iPhone XR features an LCD screen, which Apple dubs the Liquid Retina display.
                    If you've never upgraded to an iPhone X (or seen one in public) you'll likely be OK sticking with the LCD-based XR and its less vibrant colors. But you will notice the more perfect blacks from the OLED iPhones and wider viewing angles.</p><Br><hr>
					<h3>Camera</h3><br>
					<p>The iPhone XS and XS Max feature the same dual 12-megapixel cameras, with a wide-angle (ƒ/1.8 aperture) lens and and telephoto (ƒ/2.4) aperture. The iPhone XR has a single 12-megapixel wide-angle (ƒ/1.8 aperture) sensor. Those dual sensors give the iPhone XS and XS Max 2x optical zoom, and up to 10x digital zoom. The iPhone XR offers up to 5x digital zoom.
                    In terms of tricks, though, these phones are pretty similar. Both provide Smart HDR, which means greater detail and color in your photos. The XS and XR iPhones both also give you an improved Portrait Mode, with Apple's Depth Control adjustment option, so you can adjust the depth of field after you shoot a portrait mode photo. You can also adjust this setting as you shoot.</p><hr>
					<h3>Battery Life</h3><br>
					<p>To keep its 6.5-inch screen aglow, the iPhone XS Max packs the largest smartphone battery Apple's ever shipped. The XS Max lasted 10 hours and 38 minutes on our web surfing test. The smaller XS lasted only 9:41, which is a bit below the category average of 9:48.For the best battery life, you'll want the iPhone XR, which lasted 11 hours and 26 minutes on our battery test. es, that's right, the "low-end" model provides enough battery life to compete with the model you may need a loan to afford.</p><hr>
					<h3>Performance</h3><br>
					<p>If speedy performance is your highest priority, each of the new iPhones will be just as compelling. The XR, XS and XS Max all feature the same A12 Bionic processor, the industry's first 7 namometer chip (since it's beating Huawei's Kirin 980 to market) with 6.9 billion transistors.
                    The phones feature a 6-core CPU and a 4-core GPU, and the CPU feature dual high-performance cores, and four efficiency cores. Apps will launch uo to 30 percent faster, and feature enhanced, real-time machine learning. You can also expect better AR apps, with 60 frames per second performance and improved low-light performance.</p><Br>
