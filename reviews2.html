        			<p>One the upfront these might look just another flagship devices with no headline-grabbing and flashy features, although it’s the inside that packs the punch for a delightful performance experience.</p><br>

        				</ul>
        			</ul><hr>
        			<h3>Design</h3><br>	
        			<p>Pixel 3 carries more or less the same feel as we have experienced for Pixel 2, with two tone back finish. Just this time the transition is kept smoother between two finishes. The entire back is made of corning gorilla glass 5 (yup the same strengthened glass material that protects your display), so you can expect it to be quite tough from back as well. The only metal you’ll find here is the aluminum frame that’s sandwiched in between hybrid coating.
					Coming to 3XL, if you owned a Google Pixel 2 XL, you can bet for the pretty similar feel and look of Google Pixel 3 XL. The tech giant didn’t seem to bother much about making any drastic changes for Google Pixel 3 XL and rather relied on making little tweaks here and there.
					Nonetheless, as you can expect from a $999 priced smartphone, it does boasts a large crisp OLED display with a not so pretty chin at the base.
					Google has kept up with the dual stereo speakers which the company claim to be 40% more powerful than Google Pixel 2 XL; at the front side. Well, this is a nice thing really and also explains the presence of bottom bezel.
					What’s interesting is that Google was able to increase the screen size in Google Pixel 3 XL, while keeping the same factors as in Google Pixel 32 XL. This is good because now people don’t really need to practice hands stretching exercise to use a large display smartphone; finally!</p><hr>
					<h3>Display</h3><br>
					<p>Pixel 3 comes with a crisp OLED 5.5 inch screen that looks expansive and grandeur. The best part is that the company has been able to increase the display size to 5.5 inch while keeping the other dimensions similar to Pixel 2, which carried 5 inch display. So, it’s a win-win situation for people who struggles one hand use.
					Google Pixel 3 XL comes with an end-to-end large 6.3 inch OLED display with crisp color contrast and HDR supports. The amazing 18:9 screen to body ratio with 1440 x 2960 resolution certainly gives-off a sharp and clear display.</p><Br><hr>
					<h3>Camera</h3><br>
					<p>More than anything else, Google Pixel 3 & 3XL is all about the camera and the company didn’t shy away to call it the best smartphone camera in the world. Interestingly, Google has again resisted the dual camera system for rear side and retained a 12.2MP single lens camera, which after all might not be as bad as you might think and we are saying this for a reason. Remember Google Pixel 2 XL that also sported a single rear camera, however, the results were none less than impressive and we can have even better hopes with Pixel 3 XL with Machine Learning support.
					Google has introduced a new camera mood in Pixel 3 & 3XL and named in Top Shot. Well, the name says it all, by tapping into the top shot mode, you actually capture a burst of images with a single shot and alternatively can choose the best shot amongst the many. Again, we didn’t get the opportunity to go into details, however, it worked great for whatever brief time we had it with us.
					Another feature that’s fast becoming the new standard camera feature is the depth of field adjustment. Yup, we are talking about background blurring feature, where you can adjust the depth of the background in portrait shots. Then, there’s also this color pop effect that gives you a choice to take the background of the shot into grey scale while keeping the subject in colors. The single-camera means that the background effect works digitally using software, nonetheless it works perfectly fine.</p><hr>
					<h3>Performance</h3><br>
					<p>Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL runs on the latest Android 9 Pie. It was definitely a pleasing and smooth experience to run the latest Android version, however, we didn’t get the chance to check out detailed paces for an in-depth review.
					Nonetheless, the phone packs the powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset and 4GB RAM, which seems a bit low keeping in view that other manufacturers have already shifted to 6GB and even 8GB of RAM.</p><hr>
					<h3>Battery</h3><br>
					<p>Google Pixel 3 packs a 2,915mAh battery which is rather disappointing. Whereas, Pixel 3XL packs a much more rational 3430 mAh battery. We really hope that switching to Android Pie would save on battery enough to last through day-long use.
					Ok, keeping the rear side fully glass does come with its perks and wireless charging is certainly one reason why we are increasingly seeing smartphones with glass rear side. Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL are no different and both offers wireless charging.</p><Br>
